# unit-2.homework.portfolio
# This is my second homework incl: my first `index.html` file (the one I butchered after I decided to redo it for the second time, pls dont grade this one and just ignore it) my second `index2.html` which is as close as I got to finishing, the three images I have included so far, `style.css` is linked while `reset.css` is not linked because I remembered it close to the end and when I added it (above my `style.css`) it completely wrecked everything :') 

# I'm super dissapointed in myself that I wasn't able to get organized and I redid this entirely... twice.. 

# I know I need to work on: regularly adding and committing my changes instead of one big add, commit, push at the end, having a more thorough plan before I begin to code, actually finishing the homework before submitting,
